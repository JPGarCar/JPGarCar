## 🔭 I’m currently working on:
### nwPlus Hackathons Discord Bot -> [Take a Look](https://github.com/nwplus/nwPlus_discord_bot)👀
Working with [@Maggie](https://github.com/mwang2000) to launch this project to open source in hopes that it can help other hackathons run online via Discord.
It was very succesfull at both [HackCamp](https://hackcamp.nwplus.io/) and [nwHacks 2021](https://www.nwhacks.io/), but there is still much to improve!

### UBC Rec IM Timing App -> [Take a Look](https://github.com/JPGarCar/StormTheWallTimingApp)👀
My first major Java project, was scheduled to be used in production for May 2020 but Covi-19 ruined our plans 😢. However, this gives me more time to improve the software.
If this program is a success it could help other universities run races and other rally like events with ease and for free!
